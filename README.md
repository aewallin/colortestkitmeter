Abstract
===

The Instrument of Things (IoT) shows how to extend your custom electrical instruments with industry standard capabilities for remote control via a TCP/IP interface. The WIZnet WIZ550io module is used to enable a basic web server, a port mapping service and a server for remote control of the instrument using the VXI-11 communications protocol by SCPI messages. Although development has not been completed yet, feasibility is shown using an instrument for accurate measurements of a water color test kit. The ultimate goal of the Instrument of Things is to easily add the VXI-11 communications protocol and LAN eXtensions for Instruments (LXI) technology to any electrical instrument project.
